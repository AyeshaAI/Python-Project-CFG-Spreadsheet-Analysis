# Spreadsheet Analysis
A project to analyse a spreadsheet with bar charts and pie charts.
As part of my participation in the Code First Girls Python course, I developed a Python spreadsheet that enables users to perform basic data analysis on a given dataset. The project involved the following steps:

Reading data from the spreadsheet
Compiling all sales figures from each month into a unified list
Calculating the total sales across all months. Initially, the project was limited to conducting a basic movie search query. However, I expanded it to provide additional information about the movies and save the results to a text file.
To further enhance the program, I could consider the following additions:

Generating a summary of results and exporting them to a new spreadsheet
Calculating percentage changes on a monthly basis
Finding the average sales figures
Identifying the months with the highest and lowest sales
Utilizing a different dataset from a separate spreadsheet as a data source.
# What steps where taken to complete the task?
Initially, I spent some time envisioning the project and employed the MOSCOW method to prioritize the features. The MOSCOW method was used to classify the features into the following categories:
MUST: Reading data from the spreadsheet
SHOULD: Compiling all sales figures from each month into a unified list and calculating the total sales across all months
COULD: Identifying the months with the highest and lowest sales
WONT: Incorporating data from external sources

Subsequently, I utilized the data from the CSV file and wrote code to restructure the data stored in the dictionary format. The code generated a well-organized data frame that contained sales data extracted from the CSV file. I also explored various sources to enhance my code further.
I utilized Seaborn, a data visualization library, to generate various charts such as bar graphs and pie charts.
To aid me in producing charts, I referred to instructional videos on datacamp.com and geeksforgeeks.org.
# What is the focus of the course?
Code First Girls mission to address the gender diversity gap in the technology industry. 

Over the course of 8 weeks, we delved into the fundamentals of Python programming and app development. During this period, we engaged in individual learning and exercises, culminating in the presentation of a final team project showcased here. Our experience exposed us to various aspects of Python programming, Google tools, and collaborative work through the utilization of Github.
