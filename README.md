# Spreadsheet-Analysis
A project to analyse a spreadsheet with bar charts, pie charts.
As part of my participation in the Code First Girls Python course, I developed a Python spreadsheet that enables users to perform basic data analysis on a given dataset. The project involved the following steps:

Reading data from the spreadsheet
Compiling all sales figures from each month into a unified list
Calculating the total sales across all months. Initially, the project was limited to conducting a basic movie search query. However, I expanded it to provide additional information about the movies and save the results to a text file.
To further enhance the program, I could consider the following additions:

Generating a summary of results and exporting them to a new spreadsheet
Calculating percentage changes on a monthly basis
Finding the average sales figures
Identifying the months with the highest and lowest sales
Utilizing a different dataset from a separate spreadsheet as a data source.
