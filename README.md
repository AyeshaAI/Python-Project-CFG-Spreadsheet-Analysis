# Spreadsheet Analysis
A project to analyse a spreadsheet with bar charts and pie charts.
As part of my participation in the Code First Girls Python course, I developed a Python spreadsheet that enables users to perform basic data analysis on a given dataset. The project involved the following steps:

Reading data from the spreadsheet
Compiling all sales figures from each month into a unified list
Calculating the total sales across all months. Initially, the project was limited to conducting a basic movie search query. However, I expanded it to provide additional information about the movies and save the results to a text file.
To further enhance the program, I could consider the following additions:

Generating a summary of results and exporting them to a new spreadsheet
Calculating percentage changes on a monthly basis
Finding the average sales figures
Identifying the months with the highest and lowest sales
Utilizing a different dataset from a separate spreadsheet as a data source.
# What steps where taken to complete the task?
Initially, I spent some time envisioning the project and employed the MOSCOW method to prioritize the features. The MOSCOW method was used to classify the features into the following categories:
MUST: Reading data from the spreadsheet
SHOULD: Compiling all sales figures from each month into a unified list and calculating the total sales across all months
COULD: Identifying the months with the highest and lowest sales
WONT: Incorporating data from external sources

Subsequently, I utilized the data from the CSV file and wrote code to restructure the data stored in the dictionary format. The code generated a well-organized data frame that contained sales data extracted from the CSV file. I also explored various sources to enhance my code further.
I utilized Seaborn, a data visualization library, to generate various charts such as bar graphs and pie charts.
To aid me in producing charts, I referred to instructional videos on datacamp.com and geeksforgeeks.org.
# What is the focus of the course?
Code First Girls offers complimentary coding classes to women in the United Kingdom with the aim of narrowing the gender diversity gap in the technology sector. The organization has taught over 100,000 women to code to date!

The course spanned 8 weeks and covered the basics of Python programming and app development. Throughout the weeks, we completed individual learning and exercises, culminating in a final team project which is presented here. We gained insights into Python programming, Google tools, and collaborative work using Github.
